# Ray-Shadow-Casting
A basic c++/SFML ray casting algorithm.

How to use:
1) Right click to toggle light on/off.
2) i.  Left click to start drawing wall.
   ii. Left click again to place wall.
3) Move mouse to move light.

This algorithm casts 360 light rays around the light source and checks for each ray if it intersects with a wall.
If it does the intersection point becomes the end point of the ray.
